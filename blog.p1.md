# Visualizing Atmospheric Rivers 

Atmospheric Rivers (AR) are narrow regions in the atmosphere that that transport water across the world. Like a river suspended in the air, these phenonmena carry moisture from the humid tropics to temperate areas, where it has the potential to fall as rain or snow. ARs can range in size, and we depend on them to resupply water reserves. However, when a large AR stalls over an area, it also can bring the risk of heavy, damaging rainfalls and flooding.

How do we know when an AR is carrying moisture our way? Among the many meteorological indicators that are collected by the [National Oceanic + Atmospheric Administration](http://www.noaa.gov/) (NOAA) is [Precipitable Water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitable_water) (Pwat), which is the amount of water that can be extracted from the entire overlying atmosphere over a particular location on the surface of the Earth. Pwat is a key measure of the available “fuel” for the storms in the atmosphere and an estimate for much rain or snow could be produced from those storms. 

Beyond its utility, Pwat is a very striking weather variable. The complex swirling and eddying patterns bring alive atmospheric processes, and are a beautiful liquid analog to the more esoteric variable that they describe. Combining this data with reference information - coastlines, political borders, and terrain - helps to paint a clearer picture of earth surface and atmospheric interactions on our planet.

In collaboration with the [Commerce Data Service](https://www.commerce.gov/dataservice/), Mapbox has created a two part tutorial that will guide you though processing and visualizating Pwat data. You can get started with Part 1 of the tutorial at **[INSERT LINK]** or checkout the Github project at **[INSERT LINK]**. 

Expect part 2 of the tutorial next month, where we'll teach out you to create a a video-based animated map of this data like this:
